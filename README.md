# HP Probook G4 440 Hackingtosh Config files

These are OC config files for my HP ProBook, when I was working on Big Sur for Mac OS development. Nearly everything works on my end with the exception of WIFI (Intel wifi has issues with some routers and power management is a mess), this configuration is designed *specifically for this machine*. If your intent is to use it with your own machine, I strongly recommend looking at the config.plist  the file.

Again, if anything breaks, I will not be responsible. **Use it at your own risk.**

My HP Probook variant does not have a dedicated GPU, and the trackpad is a little... wobbly. I haven't tested with Monterey, but given OC's reputation as a bootloader that is persistent and doesn't break as often, I wouldn't worry too much. Still, I'd recommend to do your research before you use anything and break your expensive machine!
